NB: I have come across the polyline format before when working with geospatial data, usually the term referees to the **encoded polyline format** which abides to the [spec from google maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylineutility). There are good libraries available that deal with this in JS [https://github.com/mapbox/polyline](https://github.com/mapbox/polyline) and Python [https://pypi.org/project/polyline/](https://pypi.org/project/polyline/). The Overpass query langauge expects a decoded format.
